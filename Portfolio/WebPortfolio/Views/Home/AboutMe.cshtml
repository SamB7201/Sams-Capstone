        My name is Samuel Bowes, currently I am going to Pittsburgh Technical College for a Computer Programming Associates Degree.
        I enjoy going for rides in the mountains with my two dogs, and play games in my free time. I originaly started programming because
        I wanted to become a Game Developer. The reason I wanted to be a Game Dev is fairly simple I wanted to create something that others could enjoy
        like I enjoy when I play a game. I want people to play in a world I created or help create and get lost in it playing for hours and still having
        the time of their life.
